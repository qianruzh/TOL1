      <p> Hi there! Now that we have learned about Simple Interest, are you ready to learn more about how the interest system works? Actually, besides the Simple Interest, Compound Interest is also very common in our daily life. Let’s look at why.</p>
  		<h2>Example Questions</h2>
  		<p>Let’s meet Jerry, a middle schooler who wants to learn about personal finance. Suppose he wants to save $1000 and would like to deposit it in the bank. Jerry chooses to keep a compound interest at the rate 12%. How much money will Jerry have after 3 years?</p>
    </section>

    <section>
  		<div>
  			<b>Use the graph below and try to answer the following questions.</b>
      </div>
  		<div>
  		  <p>Sample Graph, suppose it be interactive and learners can adjust the years</p>
        <svg>AAA</svg>
  		</div>

      <h3>Fill in the blank</h3>
  		<div>
  		<ul>
        <li>1. The initial principal investment for Jerry is $____</li>
        <li>2. The interest rate that is added on to the amount Jerry invested is ___%</li>
        <li>3. The length of time this interest rate accumulates in the initial graph is  ____  year.</li>
        <li><p>4. How much will be in Jerry’s account after these years?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
            a. At the end of the first year, Jerry will have $______ interest for this year, and have $_______ in his account.
            </li> 
            <li>
            b. At the end of the second year, Jerry will have $______ interest for this year, and have $_______ in his account.
            </li> 
            <li>
            c. At the end of the third year, Jerry will have $______ interest for this year, and have $_______ in his account.
            </li>    
          </ul>
          /li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>5. Could you build on the findings in the previous question to get a possible formula for the amount of money Jerry will have at the end of n years with the 12% compound interest rate?</p>

      <p>6. What if the initial amount of money is P, the interest rate is r, the year is n, the final amount of money is A, can you build a new formula based on the previous answer?</p>
