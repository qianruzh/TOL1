      <p> Hi there! Now that we have learned about Simple Interest, are you ready to learn more about how the interest system works? Actually, besides the Simple Interest, <b>Compound Interest</b> is also very common in our daily life. Let’s look at why.</p>
  		<h2>Example Questions</h2>
      <div class="questionstyle">
  		<p class="questiontext">Let’s meet Jerry, a middle schooler who wants to learn about personal finance. Suppose he wants to save <span class="highlightp">$1000</span> and would like to deposit it in the bank. Jerry chooses to keep a compound interest at the rate <span class="highlighti">12%</span>. How much money will Jerry have after <span class="highlightt">3 years</span>?</p>
      </div>
  
  		<div class="subquestion">
  			<b>Use the graph below and try to answer the following questions.</b>
      </div>

  		<div>
  		  <p class="question">Sample Graph, suppose it be interactive and learners can adjust the years</p>
        <svg>AAA</svg>
  		</div>

      <h3>Fill in the blank</h3>

  		<div>
      <p class="question">1.The <span class="highlightp">initial principal</span> investment for Jerry is $ <input type="text" id="p1" name="answer" size="20"> . </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="question">2.The <span class="highlighti">interest rate</span> that is added on to the amount Jerry invested is <input type="text" id="p1" name="answer" size="20"> %. </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="question">3. The <span class="highlightt">length of time</span> this interest rate accumulates in the initial graph is <input type="text" id="p1" name="answer" size="20"> year.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="question">4. How much will be in Jerry’s account after these years?</p>
        <ul class="subq">
          <li class="question">
          a. At the end of the first year, Jerry will have $ <input type="text" id="p1" name="answer" size="20"> interest for this year, and have $ <input type="text" id="p1" name="answer" size="20"> in his account.
          </li> 

          <li class="question">
          b. At the end of the second year, Jerry will have $ <input type="text" id="p1" name="answer" size="20"> interest for this year, and have $ <input type="text" id="p1" name="answer" size="20"> in his account.
          </li> 

          <li class="question">
          c. At the end of the third year, Jerry will have $ <input type="text" id="p1" name="answer" size="20"> interest for this year, and have $ <input type="text" id="p1" name="answer" size="20"> in his account.
          </li>    
        </ul>
      </div>


      <p class="question">5. Could you build on the findings in the previous question to get a possible formula for the amount of money Jerry will have at the end of n years with the 12% compound interest rate? $ <span><input type="text" id="p1" name="answer" size="20"></span></p>
      

      <p class="question">6. What if the initial amount of money is P, the interest rate is r, the year is n, the final amount of money is A, can you build a new formula based on the previous answer? $ <span><input type="text" id="p1" name="answer" size="20"></span></p>
