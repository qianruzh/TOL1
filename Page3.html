      <p>Now we have learned the formula to calculate compound interest, let’s try to use formula to solve the problem.  </p>

  		<h2>Example Questions</h2>
  		<p>Mr. Z makes an initial investment of $ 5,000 for a period of 3 years. Find the value of the investment after the three years if the investment earns the annual return of 12 % compounded monthly.</p>

  		<div>
  			<b>The process to solve this problem would be:</b>
  			
  			<div>
  			<p>P (Initial value of investment) = $</p> 
  			<div>5,000</div>
  			</div>

  			<div>
  			<p>i (Rate of return each compound) =</p> 
  			<div>it is compounded monthly, so i should be the monthly return rate. Now we only know the annual return rate is 12%, so the monthly return rate should be 12%/12=1%</div>
  			</div>

  			<div>
  			<p>t (total compounded times) =</p> 
  			<div>since it’s compounded monthly, so t should be 3*12 = 36 months in 3 years</div>
  			</div>

  			<div>
  			<p>A =</p> 
  			<div>P(1 +i)^n = 5000*(1+ 1%)^36 = 7,153.84</div>

  		<h2>Additional Questions</h2>
  		<p>Suppose you have $1000, you can either choose to save it by keeping a simple interest at the rate of 12%, or to keep a compound interest at the rate of 10%, which one would you choose?</p>
