      <p>Now we have learned the formula to calculate compound interest, let’s try to use formula to solve the problem.  </p>

  		<h2>Example Questions</h2>
  		<p class="questiontext">Mr. Z makes an initial investment of $ <span class="highlightp">5,000</span> for a period of <span class="highlightt">3 years</span>. Find the value of the investment after the three years if the investment earns the annual return of <span class="highlighti">12 %</span> compounded monthly.</p>

  		<div>
  			<b>The process to solve this problem would be:</b>
  			
  			<div>
  			<p>P (Initial value of investment) = $ 5000</p> 
  			</div>

  			<div>
  			<p>i (Rate of return each compound) =</p> 
  			<div>it is compounded monthly, so i should be the monthly return rate. Now we only know the annual return rate is 12%, so the monthly return rate should be 12%/12=1%</div>
  			</div>

  			<div>
  			<p>t (total compounded times) =</p> 
  			<div>since it’s compounded monthly, so t should be 3*12 = 36 months in 3 years</div>
  			</div>

  			<div>
  			<p>A =</p> 
  			<div>P(1 +i)^n = 5000*(1+ 1%)^36 = 7,153.84</div>
