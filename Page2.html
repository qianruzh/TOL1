    <h2>Case Study</h2>
    <p>Jack deposited $10,000 at 20% per annum compounded quarterly in Bank A. After 6 month he withdrew the money. What is the total amount and interest he got?</p>

    <!-- STEP 1 -->
    <h3>Step 1: identify key features in the questions</h3>
    <p>To answer this question, we are going to figure out the following questions by using the highlighted part in the case:</p>
    <b>How much is Jack's principal?</b><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="10000">
        <label>10000</label><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="20%">
        <label>20%</label><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="quarterly">
        <label>quarterly</label><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="6 months">
        <label>6 months</label><br/>
    
    <b>By what percentage is the principal going to increase annually？</b><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="10000">
        <label>10000</label><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="20%">
        <label>20%</label><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="quarterly">
        <label>quarterly</label><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="6 months">
        <label>6 months</label><br/>
    
    <b>How often will compound interest be calculated?</b><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="10000">
        <label>10000</label><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="20%">
        <label>20%</label><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="quarterly">
        <label>quarterly</label><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="6 months">
        <label>6 months</label><br/>

    <b>How long later Jack withdrew the money from the bank?</b>
        <input type="radio" value="10000">
        <label>10000</label><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="20%">
        <label>20%</label><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="quarterly">
        <label>quarterly</label><br/>
        <input type="radio" value="6 months">
        <label>6 months</label><br/>
    
    <p><b>Let's answer the following two questions to convert the problem into a percentage change problem: </b></p>
    <p>We already know “by what percentage is the principal going to increase annually” and “how often will 
        compound interest be calculated”. </p>
    <p><b>Do you know by what percentage is the principal going to increase each time when calculating the 
        compound interest? </b></p>
    <input type="text" placeholder="placeholder text">

    <p>We already know “How long later Jack withdrew the money from the bank”. </p>
    <p><b>During that time, how many times will the compound interest be calculated? </b></p>
    <input type="text" placeholder="placeholder text">

    <!-- STEP 2 -->
    <h3>Step 2: connect the features with the invented formula</h3>
    <p>Now the question has been converted to increase 10000 by 5% twice.</p>
    <p><b>By using the formula “A(n) = P(1 +i)^n” you’ve invented, could you explain the meaning of each symbol in the formula?</b>
        E.g. A means the sum of principal and interest, which is what we are going to calculate.</p>
    <p>P means <input type="text" placeholder="placeholder text">, which is: <input type="text" placeholder="placeholder text"> </p>
    <p>i means <input type="text" placeholder="placeholder text">, which is: <input type="text" placeholder="placeholder text"> </p>
    <p>n means <input type="text" placeholder="placeholder text">, which is: <input type="text" placeholder="placeholder text"> </p>


    <!-- STEP 3 -->
    <h3>Step 3: answer the question based on the formula and the values</h3>
    <p>You have identified the meaning and exact values of the symbols in the formula. Answer the following fill-in-the-blank questions:</p>
    <p><b>What is the total amount Jack got after 6 month?</b></p>
    <input type="text" placeholder="placeholder text">
    <p><b>Briefly explain how to calculate the interest?</b></p>
    <input type="text" placeholder="placeholder text">
    <p><b>What is the total amount Jack got after 6 month?</b></p>
    <input type="text" placeholder="placeholder text">
